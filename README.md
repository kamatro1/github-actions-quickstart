# github-actions-quickstart
CIS 3500 Spring 2024 Homework 2 Part 1

The goal of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with GitHub Actions, and learn from and provide feedback on documentation. It contains the following files:

## Files

### 1. README.md üìÑ
You're reading it! This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

### 2. .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml üìÅ
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow. It's a configuration file that tells GitHub Actions how to run your code.

### 3. CLAUDE-GITHUB-ACTIONS-CONVERSATION.pdf üí¨
This PDF file contains a conversation with Claude, an AI assistant from Anthropic, where I asked for a line-by-line explanation of the `github-actions-demo.yml` file. Claude helped me understand the GitHub Actions syntax and concepts.

### 4. FEEDBACK-1.png & FEEDBACK-2.png üëç
These screenshots capture the feedback I provided on the GitHub Actions Quickstart documentation. `FEEDBACK-1.png` shows the initial feedback, and `FEEDBACK-2.png` shows the confirmation after submitting the feedback.

## Assignment Steps

The assignment involved the following steps:

1. **Create a Public Repository**: I created this `github-actions-quickstart` public repository.

2. **Follow the GitHub Actions Quickstart**: I followed the [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) guide, which walked me through creating the `github-actions-demo.yml` workflow file.

3. **Ask Claude for Help**: I copy-pasted the `github-actions-demo.yml` file into a conversation with Claude, an AI assistant, and asked for a line-by-line explanation. The conversation was saved as `CLAUDE-GITHUB-ACTIONS-CONVERSATION.pdf`.

4. **Submit Feedback on the Documentation**: I provided feedback on the GitHub Actions Quickstart documentation by rating and leaving a comment. The feedback and confirmation screenshots were saved as `FEEDBACK-1.png` and `FEEDBACK-2.png`.

*Note: this readme.md file was created with the help of Anthropic's Claude, partially based off the assignment description*
